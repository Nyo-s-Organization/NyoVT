This project has started to make 3d vtubing more accessible on linux, windows isn't our focus.  
Ofcourse with it being Unity windows should work more than fine but this is our disclaimer.

It's heavily inspired by VSeeFace but I was missing some features,  
one was streaming to web which I'm still working on and a way to make the background green for green screen.  
I normally set the red ambience on VSeeFace higher so I can chroma key the gray background,  
this is one of the compromises to using it on linux, but by using the green screen it would be more than possible.  

Why the browser streaming? On linux, specifically Wayland the loading of windows in obs is quite annoying,  
this makes that browser sources are more reliable most of the time.
